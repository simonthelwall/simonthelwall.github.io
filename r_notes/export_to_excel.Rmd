```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

There are a lot of options for taking data from R to Excel. 
I've settled with openxlsx for two reasons:

 * No java dependencies
 * Able to add formatting 
 
## Setup 

```{r setup2}
library(openxlsx)
data("mtcars")

my_workbook <- createWorkbook(creator = "Simon Thelwall")
```

## Add data

```{r add-data}
writeData(wb = my_workbook, x = mtcars, sheet = 1, startCol = 3, startRow = 3,
          colNames = TRUE)
```

## Add some styling

```{r add-style}
header_style <- createStyle(textDecoration = "bold", border = c("top", "bottom"),
                            borderStyle = "thin", borderColour = "black")
footer_style <- createStyle(border = c("bottom"),
                            borderStyle = "thin", borderColour = "black")

addStyle(wb = my_workbook)
```
